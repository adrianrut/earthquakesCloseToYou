# EarthquakesCloseToYou
is a simple API to find earthquakes from the last 24 hours.
The app connects to the Google Maps API to find the input city.
It then connects to the earthquake.usgs.gov API where you can get information about recent earthquakes.
The application uses an algorithm that counts the distance between the city and the earthquake site.
To use, simply add your Google Maps API key.
